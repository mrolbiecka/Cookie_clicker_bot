# Cookie_clicker_bot
A game bot created during the bootcamp
This project is a bot that automates the game **Cookie Clicker** on 
[Orteil's Cookie Clicker Experiment](http://orteil.dashnet.org/experiments/cookie/), 
written in Python using the **Selenium** library. 
The bot clicks on a cookie and buys upgrades, trying to reach the maximum number of cookies in the game as quickly as possible.
### Features:
- **Clicking on a cookie**: The bot automatically clicks on a cookie to earn cookies.
- **Buying upgrades**: The bot decides which upgrades (e.g. Cursor, Grandma, Factory) can be purchased based on the amount of cookies you have.
- **Determining which upgrade is the most profitable**: The bot analyzes the available upgrades and buys the ones that are the most profitable at the moment.
